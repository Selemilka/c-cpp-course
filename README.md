# C/C++ Course

## About

The assignments were made as a part of C/C++ course in ISPRAS (tutor: Ilya Dedinsky).  
The main purpose of this course is to make all these tasks mostly in enterprise/production style, so some parts of projects are too decomposed, but imagine that these projects are really big and maintained by many people.
