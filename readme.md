# Documentation for quadratic equasions # {#mainpage}

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is creating solver for quadratic equasions in enterprise/production style, like it's really big project. Some parts of this code shouldn't be decomposed so much, but imaginate that it's big project that maintained by many people.

## Description

This project solves quadratic equasions \f$ax^2 + bx + c = 0\f$.

## Build

Use "make" command for building this project (requires makefile). 
Use "make clean" command for removing *.o files in project.
Use "make run-tests" command for running tests for this project.

## Documentation

Use "doxygen" for generating documentation (requires doxygen).
